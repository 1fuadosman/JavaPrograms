******Static Methods******
- Static methods are declared using a static modifiers
- Static methods cant access instance methods and instance variables directly
- They are usually used for operations that dont require any data from an instance
of the class(from 'this')
- If you remember, the this keyword is the current instance of class
- In static methods we cant use the this keyword
- Whenever you see a method that does not use instance variables that method should
be declared as static method
- For example main is a static method and
- Instance method can call a static method or static variable, but
- static method cannot call instance method or instance method
- Note you dont need to instantiate the class wih new to use static methods,
you can just call the static methods directly eg Calculator.calcuate();


******Instance Methods******
- Instance methods belong to an instance of a class
- To use an instance method we have to instantiate the class first usually by using the new
keyword.
- Instance methids can access instance methods and instance varibales directly
- Instance methods can also access static methods and static variables directly
